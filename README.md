## Overview

- Python & Jupyter Notebook for analysis and modeling  
- Basic dashboard/report in Word document  
- Power BI dashboard file included for interactive visualizations

---

## Business Questions

- Who is likely to churn?  
- Key factors affecting churn  
- Churn patterns by demographics and payment method  
- Model accuracy comparison
